# Using LCS [](id=using-lcs)

Once your @product@ server is connected to LCS, you can get down to the business 
that LCS is designed for--managing and monitoring your servers. If you're not 
already there, log in with your account on 
[lcs.liferay.com](https://lcs.liferay.com). This is where you'll apply updates, 
view server metrics, manage environments, and more. 

This article's sections each detail one or more of LCS's features: 

-   [**What LCS Stores About Your @product@ Servers:**](#what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers)
    For LCS to work, the LCS servers must store certain information about your 
    servers. Sensitive data, however, isn't stored on the LCS servers. This 
    section describes the data that LCS does and doesn't store. 

-   [**Managing LCS Users in Your Project:**](#managing-lcs-users-in-your-project)
    Learn how to manage your LCS project's users by assigning them roles. 

-   [**Using the Dashboard:**](#using-the-dashboard)
    Learn how to manage projects, environments, and servers in LCS. This 
    includes applying fix packs, monitoring server status, viewing server 
    metrics, and more. 

-   [**Using Web Notifications:**](#using-web-notifications) 
    LCS displays web notifications that you can view by clicking the bell icon 
    next to the user menu in the Dockbar. Learn how to manage these. 

-   [**Managing Your LCS Account:**](#managing-your-lcs-account)
    Learn how to manage your LCS account. This includes configuring LCS to send 
    you notification emails when specific events occur in your LCS projects, and 
    setting general account preferences. 

-   [**Managing @product@ Subscriptions:**](#managing-liferay-dxp-subscriptions)
    Learn how to view and manage your @product@ subscriptions for the servers in 
    your LCS project. 

-   [**Understanding Environment Tokens:**](#using-environment-tokens)
    Learn about the environment tokens that you use to connect your servers to 
    LCS. 

## What LCS Stores About Your @product@ Servers [](id=what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers)

At this point, you might be wondering what information about your servers is 
stored on LCS's servers. Great question! To protect your users' privacy, LCS 
only stores system-specific data. LCS doesn't gather or store data on your 
users. 

By default, LCS stores the following information about your server:

-   Portal build number and edition
-   Patching Tool Version
-   LCS Client Build Number 
-   Application Server Name
-   Database Name
-   File Encoding
-   OS Name and Version
-   Timezone
-   IP Address
-   Java Version and Java Options
-   Number of Processor Cores
-   File System Usage
-   Memory Usage 

The other data LCS stores depends on the services you enable in your environment 
token. For more information on this, see 
[the article on activating servers with LCS](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/registering-your-dxp-server-with-lcs).
When you enable the following services, LCS gathers and stores the data listed 
for each: 

-   **Portal analytics:** 

    -   Portal and portlet metrics
    -   JVM metrics
    -   Cache and server metrics 

-   **Fix pack management:**

    -   Patches installed on the server 

-   **Portal properties analysis:** 

    -   `portal.properties` (except sensitive data) 

Sensitive data is any key-value pair that contains usernames or passwords. For 
example, LCS doesn't store the following properties because they contain 
sensitive data: 

    omniadmin.users
    ldap.security.credentials.0, ldap.security.credentials.1, ldap.security.credentials.2 ...
    facebook.connect.app.secret
    auth.token.shared.secret
    auth.mac.shared.key
    captcha.engine.recaptcha.key.private
    amazon.secret.access.key
    tunneling.servlet.shared.secret
    microsoft.translator.client.secret
    dl.store.s3.secret.key
    auto.deploy.glassfish.jee.dm.passwd

LCS also doesn't store properties that end in `.password`, besides the following 
non-sensitive properties: 

    portal.jaas.plain.password
    portal.jaas.strict.password
    login.create.account.allow.custom.password

LCS also lets you prevent it from analyzing specific properties of your 
choosing. For more information on this, see 
[the article on activating servers with LCS](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/registering-your-dxp-server-with-lcs).

## Managing LCS Users in Your Project [](id=managing-lcs-users-in-your-project)

The Users section of LCS is where you manage the LCS users that are part of your 
project. It's here that you can grant or revoke LCS roles. To manage users, 
first click the *Users* tab just below the Dashboard tab on the upper-left of 
your screen. 

+$$$

**Note:** You can't add users to your project via the LCS UI or the LCS client 
app. To add users to your project, you must contact Liferay support. 

$$$

![Figure 1: The Users tab lets you manage the LCS users in your project.](../../images-dxp/lcs-users.png)

The *Users* tab displays a list of the users in your project. This list includes 
each user's name, email, image, LCS roles, and a *Manage Roles* button. Each LCS 
user must have an assigned role. The following roles are available: 

- **LCS Administrator:** All LCS functionality is available to administrators. 
  This is the only role that can manage the roles of other users. 
- **LCS Environment Manager:** All LCS functionality is available in the scope 
  of an environment, with the exception of managing other users. 
- **LCS Environment Viewer:** Has read-only access in the scope of an 
  environment.

You should note that each of these LCS roles assume that the user already has 
the LCS User role in their Liferay.com account. The LCS User role is granted 
automatically the first time the user enters their LCS account. The actions that 
can be performed by each of the LCS roles are detailed in the below permissions 
matrix. 

**LCS Permissions Matrix**

Action | &nbsp;LCS Administrator | &nbsp;LCS Environment Manager | &nbsp;LCS Environment Viewer |
------ | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
Access LCS | true | true | true |
Access Any Environment | true | false | false |
Access a Particular Environment | true | true | true |
Manage Users | true | false | false |
Create and Delete Environments | true | false | false |
Edit Any Environment | true | false | false |
Edit a Particular Environment | true | true | false |
Server Registration in Any Environment | true | false | false |
Server Registration in a Particular Environment | true | true | false |
Install Fix Packs in Any Environment | true | false | false |
Install Fix Packs in a Particular Environment | true | true | false |

Now that you know what roles are available in an LCS project, and what they do, 
you're ready to learn how to manage them.

### Managing LCS Roles [](id=managing-lcs-roles)

Follow these steps to manage a user's LCS roles:

1.  Click the user's *Manage Roles* button. 

2.  To revoke a role, click *Revoke Role* for that role. 

3.  To assign a role, choose the role (and environment, if applicable) and click 
    *Assign*. 

+$$$

**Note:** A user can't have an environment role (e.g., LCS Environment Manager, 
LCS Environment Viewer) and the LCS Administrator role at the same time. 

$$$

![Figure 2: You can assign or revoke a user's LCS roles.](../../images-dxp/lcs-user-roles.png)

Great! Now you know how to manage users and roles in your LCS projects. Now it's 
time to get to the heart of LCS: the Dashboard. 

## Using the Dashboard [](id=using-the-dashboard)

The LCS Dashboard lets you view and manage a project's environments and servers. 
If you're not already at the Dashboard, click it near the upper left-hand corner 
of your LCS site. Clicking *Dashboard* takes you to the project view. From 
there, you can get to the environment view and the server view. Each of these 
views gives you a different look into certain aspects of your LCS project. 
You'll start with the project view. 

### Using the Project View [](id=using-the-project-view)

You can get to the project view at any time by clicking the *Dashboard* tab near 
the upper left-hand corner of your LCS site. The project is listed to the right 
of this tab, with a drop-down arrow that lets you switch between projects if you 
have more than one. You can also switch between projects from the user menu at 
the top right of the Dockbar. The project view contains a Status table that 
lists any status messages for each server in your project. For example, a status 
message appears for a server when the server is offline. Status messages also 
appear for servers when fix packs are available, monitoring is unavailable, the 
patching tool is unavailable, or other events occur that relate to LCS. 

![Figure 3: The LCS project view shows an overview of your LCS project.](../../images-dxp/lcs-project-view.png)

LCS lists the environments in your project on the left side of the screen. You 
can also create new environments here by clicking the *Add Environment* tab 
(more on this shortly). To view an environment's settings, click the 
environment's gear icon. You can also get more information about a specific 
environment by clicking it. This takes you to the environment view. Also note 
that each environment's icon indicates the environment's type and status: 

- **Red icon:** There's a problem with one or more of the environment's servers. 
- **Green icon:** The environment's servers are operating properly. 
- **Icon with a circle:** The environment's servers are clustered. 

Now you'll learn how to create an environment. 

### Creating an Environment [](id=creating-an-environment)

You can create an environment by clicking the *Add Environment* tab from the 
Dashboard. This opens the New Environment popup. 

+$$$

**Note:** When creating an environment, make your selections carefully for the 
*Subscription Type*, *Cluster*, and *Elastic* fields. You can't change them 
after creating the environment.

$$$

Complete these fields to create your environment: 

-   **Environment Name:** The environment's name.
-   **Description:** The environment's description.
-   **Subscription Type:** The environment's subscription type. Servers 
    activated in the environment will consume an activation key from this 
    subscription type. Note that you can't change this after creating the 
    environment. 
-   **Cluster:** Whether this is a clustered environment. Only clustered 
    environments can contain clustered servers. Note that you can't change this 
    after creating the environment. Also note that you must set the portal 
    property `cluster.link.enabled` to `true` in any servers that connect to a 
    clustered environment. 
-   **Elastic:** Whether this environment permits the use of *elastic 
    subscriptions*. Note that you can't change this after creating the 
    environment. Elastic subscriptions let you register an unlimited number of 
    servers. This is crucial for auto-scaling environments in which servers are 
    created and destroyed automatically. For more information, see 
    [the documentation on elastic subscriptions](#elastic-subscriptions). 
-   **Services:** The LCS services to enable in the environment. Note that 
    although 
    [LCS doesn't access security sensitive properties](#what-lcs-stores-about-your-liferay-servers), 
    you may have additional properties you want to prevent LCS from analyzing. 
    Enter them into the popup that appears when you click *Blacklisted 
    Properties*. This Blacklisted Properties popup lists the currently 
    blacklisted properties and lets you add additional ones to the list. 

When you're finished with your selections, click *Create Environment*. 

![Figure 4: The New Environment popup.](../../images-dxp/lcs-new-environment.png)

Next, you'll learn how to manage your environments. 

### Using the Environment View [](id=using-the-environment-view)

Clicking an environment on the left-hand side of the project view takes you to 
the environment view. The environment view lets you manage an environment in 
your LCS project. 

The UI is segmented into three tabs: 

1.  **Fix Packs:** lets you view and apply fix packs for the environment's 
    servers. This tab only appears if a server is registered in the environment. 
    A table displays the following information for each fix pack: 

    -   **Name:** The fix pack's name.
    -   **Status:** The fix pack's status.
    -   **Server:** The server the fix pack can be applied to.
    -   **Size:** The fix pack's size. This only appears if the server is 
        running. 
    -   **Download:** A button to download the fix pack to the server. This only 
        appears if the server is running. 

    Once a fix pack downloads, LCS prompts you to restart your server, which 
    installs any downloaded fix packs. Note that you must start your server with 
    the privileges required to write to the disk location where patches are 
    stored and processed (the `patching-tool` folder). To use LCS to install fix 
    packs across a cluster, follow the same procedure. LCS downloads and 
    installs fix packs simultaneously across all nodes--you don't have to handle 
    each separately. 

2.  **Registration:** lets you generate and download 
    [*environment tokens*](#using-environment-tokens) 
    that connect your servers to LCS. 

3.  **Environment Settings:** lets you change the environment's name, location, 
    and description. You can also see if the environment allows clustered 
    servers, and view the environment's subscription type. Click the *Save* 
    button to save any changes you make in the Environment Settings tab. You can 
    also delete the environment by clicking *Delete Environment*. 

![Figure 5: The LCS environment view shows an overview of an LCS environment.](../../images-dxp/lcs-environment-view.png)

Regardless of the tab you're in, the left side of the screen displays a list of 
the environment's servers. To view a server's settings, click the server's gear 
icon. Clicking on a server takes you to its server view. 

### Using the Server View [](id=using-the-server-view)

The server view provides detailed information about a server, including 
statistics and performance metrics. To protect your users' privacy, LCS doesn't 
gather, store, or analyze user data. You can get to the server view by clicking 
a server in the environment view, or by clicking a server in the Fix Packs or 
Status tables. 

Server view is segmented into six tabs: 

- **Page Analytics:** Displays metrics on page views and load times.
- **Snapshot Metrics:** Displays application, JVM, and server metrics.
- **Fix Packs:** Displays the server's available and installed fix packs.
- **Portal Properties:** Displays your portal's properties and their settings.
- **Details:** Displays general information about your @product@ installation, 
  Java version, and hardware.
- **Server Settings:** View or change your server's name, location, and 
  description. You can also unregister the server from LCS. 

+$$$

**Note:** LCS doesn't support *Snapshot Metrics* for servers running on JBoss or 
WildFly. In this scenario, you may see a console message indicating that LCS 
doesn't support server metrics for your application server. You may also see a 
benign `NullPointerException` for the LCS `TaskSchedulerServiceImpl` and 
`ScheduleTasksCommand`. 

$$$

#### Page Analytics [](id=page-analytics)

Page Analytics is displayed by default when you enter server view. Page 
Analytics shows page views and load times for the selected site and time period. 
By default, all sites are selected. You can select a specific site from the 
*Site* selector menu. You can also select a different time period in the 
*Period* and *Ending At* fields. The arrows next to the *Ending At* field move 
the selected time period up or down, respectively, by one period. For example, 
if you select *One Hour* in the *Period* field, then pressing the right arrow 
next to *Ending At* moves the selected time period up by one hour. Note that at 
the beginning of the current time period, it can take up to 15 minutes for data 
to become available. Also note that data is available for three months from the 
time LCS collected it. 

By default, load times and page views for all pages are plotted against time in 
separate graphs. Below these graphs, a table displays summary statistics of 
these data over the same time period, for each page. If you click a page in the 
table, the graphs change to plot the data for just that page. If you can't 
find the page you're looking for, you can search for it in the *Search* box at 
the top of the table. To plot data for all pages again, click the *All Pages* 
row at the bottom of the table. 

Load times are also color coded to indicate speed. The *Load Times* graph's 
background is red for values above 3,000 ms, orange for values from 2,000 to 
3,000 ms, and green for values less than 2,000 ms. Likewise, the table displays 
all load times greater than 3,000 ms in red text. 

![Figure 6: The Page Analytics interface in the LCS Server view.](../../images-dxp/lcs-page-analytics-01.png)

#### Snapshot Metrics [](id=snapshot-metrics)

To view other metrics and statistics of your server's performance, click the 
*Snapshot Metrics* tab near the top of the page. These metrics are broken down 
into three main categories: *Application*, *JVM*, and *Server*. Application is 
selected by default when you click the Snapshot Metrics button. 

The Application category also has three other categories: *Pages*, *Portlets*, 
and *Cache*. Pages lists the frequency that specific pages load, along with 
their average load time. Portlets lists the same statistics, but for specific 
portlets in your server. The Cache category lists Liferay Single VM metrics and 
Hibernate metrics. The following screenshot shows the statistics in the Portlets 
category.

![Figure 7: The LCS application metrics show portlet performance statistics, like frequency of use and average load time.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-metrics-application-portlets.png)

The JVM category, as its name indicates, shows statistics about the JVM running 
on your server. This includes data on the garbage collector and memory. The 
number of runs, total time, and average time are listed for each garbage 
collector item. The memory metrics are presented in a bar chart that shows the 
usage of the PS Survivor Space, PS Old Gen, PS Eden Space, Code Cache, and PS 
Perm Gen.

![Figure 8: The LCS JVM metrics show performance data for memory and the garbage collector.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-metrics-jvm.png)

Server is the third category in Snapshot Metrics. The Server category shows 
additional information about how your server is running. For example, a 
horizontal bar graph shows the number of current threads running on your server. 
Similarly, horizontal bar graphs are used to represent the JDBC connection 
pools. 

![Figure 9: The LCS server metrics show current threads and JDBC connection pools.](../../images-dxp/lcs-metrics-server.png)

Note that in Snapshot Metrics, the application and garbage collector metrics are 
based on data collected by LCS from server registration to the present. Memory 
and server metrics, however, show only the current state. 

#### Fix Packs [](id=fix-packs)

To view your server's fix packs, click the Fix Packs tab near the top of the 
page. The available and installed fix packs appear in separate tables. The 
available fix packs table functions exactly like the Fix Packs table in 
environment view for downloading and installing fix packs. 

![Figure 10: The Fix Packs tab displays your server's available and installed fix packs.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-fix-packs.png)

#### Portal Properties [](id=portal-properties)

The *Portal Properties* tab lets you view your portal's property values in a 
searchable table. This gives you a convenient display for seeing exactly what 
your portal properties are set to. The properties in this table are organized 
into the following categories: 

- **Default Values:** The default values for your portal's properties. 

- **Custom Values:** Any custom values you've set for your portal's properties. 
  This includes any property values you change via a `portal-ext.properties` 
  file.

- **Dynamic Properties:** Any property values set at runtime. For example, the 
  [Liferay Home](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/installing-product#liferay-home) 
  folder's location depends on your configuration. To always specify this folder 
  when setting any properties that require it, you can use `${liferay.home}` 
  instead of an absolute directory path. 

You can display any combination of these categories by selecting the 
corresponding checkboxes from the gear icon next to the search box at the 
top-right of the table. For example, by checking the *Show Default Values* and 
*Show Custom Values* checkboxes, the table shows your portal's default and 
custom property values. To show only the custom values, select only *Show Custom 
Values*. 

![Figure 11: Click the gear icon to select the type of portal properties to show in the table.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-portal-properties.png)

#### Details [](id=details)

The *Details* tab shows general information about your server. There are three 
tabs under Details: *Software*, *Java*, and *Hardware*. Each shows information, 
respectively, about your @product@ installation, Java installation, and 
hardware. This information is useful to the Liferay Support team in the event 
that you need their assistance. 

![Figure 12: The Details tab shows information about your server.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-details.png)

#### Server Settings [](id=server-settings)

Lastly, the *Server Settings* tab lets you view and edit your server's name, 
location, and description. You can also unregister your server from LCS. 

![Figure 13: You can use the Server Settings tab to give your server a fun name.](../../images-dxp/lcs-server-settings.png)

As you can see, the LCS Dashboard is a powerful tool that greatly simplifies 
the update process and also gives you extensive information on how your servers 
are running. Next, you'll learn how to use LCS web notifications. 

## Using Web Notifications [](id=using-web-notifications)

LCS also displays web notifications that you can view by clicking the bell icon 
in the Dockbar. A red badge on this icon shows your unread notification count. 
LCS and Liferay Support send these notifications. For example, LCS generates 
notifications when a server shuts down or some other event requiring your 
attention occurs. To mark a notification as read, click the small *x* icon next 
to it. To mark all notifications as read, click the *Mark All as Read* button. 
To mark notifications as unread again, click the *Undo* button that appears. To 
see your notification history, click the *Notifications History* button. You can 
also access your notification history by selecting *My Account* from the user 
menu in the Dockbar. 

![Figure 14: Web notifications let you know what's happening in your LCS projects.](../../images-dxp/lcs-user-web-notifications.png)

Next, you'll learn how to manage your LCS account. 

## Managing Your LCS Account [](id=managing-your-lcs-account)

To manage your LCS account, select *My Account* from the user menu in the 
Dockbar. This takes you to a UI that contains three tabs: 

-   **Email Notifications:** Configure LCS to send you emails when specific 
    events occur in your LCS projects. You do this by adding rules that define 
    what events trigger a notification. There are no rules by default. Click the 
    *Add Rule* button to define one. 

    First specify the project, environment, and server for the notification. 
    Note that you have the option of selecting all environments and servers in a
    project. Then check the checkbox for each event that you want to trigger an 
    email notification. For example, if you create a notification rule with *The 
    server unexpectedly shuts down* selected for all servers and environments in 
    your project, then LCS sends you an email when any server in your project 
    goes offline without a normal shut down event. Click *Save* when you're done 
    defining the notification rule. It then appears in a table along with any 
    other existing rules. Each has an Actions button that lets you edit or 
    delete it. 

    ![Figure 15: You can add rules to determine the events that trigger notifications.](../../images-dxp/lcs-add-notification-rule.png)

-   **Notification History:** Displays your web notification history in a 
    searchable table. You can also select the date range from which to display 
    notifications. 

-   **Preferences:** Manage your LCS account's general preferences. You can 
    change your account's language, time zone, and default LCS project. Your 
    default LCS project is the one shown each time you log in to LCS. 

    ![Figure 16: You can change your LCS account's general preferences.](../../images-dxp/lcs-account-preferences.png)

Great! Now you know how to manage your LCS account. Next, you'll learn how to 
use LCS to work with your @product@ subscriptions. 

## Managing @product@ Subscriptions [](id=managing-liferay-dxp-subscriptions)

LCS lets you use and view your @product@ subscriptions. Recall that when you 
[create an environment](#creating-an-environment), 
you assign its subscription type. Registering a server in that environment 
consumes an activation key from that subscription type. You can also view your 
project's available subscriptions and see how they're being used. 

Depending on your subscription agreement, LCS also lets you register servers via 
*elastic subscriptions*. Elastic subscriptions let you register an unlimited 
number servers. This is invaluable in auto-scaling environments, where servers 
are automatically created and destroyed in response to load. 

You can access these features from the *Subscriptions* tab on the upper-left of 
the LCS site. This tab contains two other tabs: *Details* and *Elastic 
Subscriptions*. 

![Figure 17: LCS lets you view and manage your subscriptions.](../../images-dxp/lcs-subscriptions.png)

There are four tables in the *Details* tab: 

1.  **Subscriptions:** shows a list of the available subscriptions in your LCS 
    project. For each subscription, this table shows the following information: 

    - Subscription Type
    - Start Date
    - Expiration Date
    - Support End Date
    - Platform
    - Product
    - Processor Cores Allowed
    - Servers Allowed
    - Servers Used

    Note that *Processor Cores Allowed* shows the number of processor cores that 
    the subscription allows for each server. 

2.  **Subscriptions Summary:** shows how your subscriptions are currently used 
    in your project. For each subscription type, this table shows the number of 
    servers allowed, used, and available. 

3.  **Project Environments:** shows your project's environments and their 
    assigned subscription types. Each environment must have a subscription type. 

4.  **Project Servers:** shows the environment and subscription type for each 
    server in your LCS project. 

If any of the information in these tables is missing or incorrect, contact 
Liferay Support. 

+$$$

**Note:** If you try to register a server that exceeds the number of processor 
cores that your subscription allows per server, the registration fails and the 
server is locked down. A console error also indicates the server's core count. 
You can compare this with your subscription's processor cores allowed in LCS's 
Subscriptions table. To register the server, you can either reduce the number of 
cores it uses (e.g., by deploying to different server hardware, or reducing the 
number of virtual processors in a VM or container), or contact Liferay Sales to 
increase the number of processor cores that your subscription allows per server. 

$$$

### Decommissioning Servers [](id=decommissioning-servers)

To decommission a server and free its activation key for reuse, select the 
server's environment on the left and then select the server. In the server's 
*Server Settings* tab, select *Unregister*. Also note that when you shut down a 
server normally, its activation key is immediately freed for reuse. If the 
server crashes or its shutdown is forced (e.g., kill), its activation key is 
freed for reuse within six minutes. 

Next, you'll learn how to use elastic subscriptions with LCS. 

### Elastic Subscriptions [](id=elastic-subscriptions)

Elastic subscriptions let you register an unlimited number of servers. This is 
crucial for auto-scaling environments in which servers are created and destroyed 
automatically. You can view data on your elastic servers from the 
*Subscriptions* tab's *Elastic Subscriptions* tab. 

+$$$

**Note:** To register elastic servers in an environment, that environment must 
be set as elastic when it's created. For more information, see the 
[documentation on creating environments](#creating-an-environment).

$$$

![Figure 18: The *Elastic Subscriptions* tab shows details about your project's elastic servers.](../../images-dxp/lcs-elastic-subscriptions.png)

The *Elastic Subscriptions* tab displays the number of elastic servers online 
and the uptime details for each. A graph shows the number of elastic servers 
online each day, while a table lists each elastic server's start time, end time, 
and duration. The total duration for servers is below the table. To download a 
report of the table's data, click *Download Report*. Also, you can use the 
*Environment* and *Month* selectors above the graph to select the environment 
and month to show data from, respectively. The data in both the graph and the 
table reflect your selections here. 

The next section shows you how to use environment tokens to activate servers 
with LCS. 

## Understanding Environment Tokens [](id=using-environment-tokens)

To activate a server in an environment, you must use that environment's token 
file. LCS Administrators and Environment Managers can generate and distribute 
this file. It contains all the information the LCS client app needs to activate 
the server in the environment. When the server starts up, it uses the token to 
connect to LCS and consume an activation key from the environment's 
subscription. This lets you activate servers automatically on startup--no 
interaction is required.

**Note:** For instructions on using and managing your environment tokens, see 
the instructions on 
[activating your server with LCS](https://customer.liferay.com/documentation/7.0/deploy/-/official_documentation/deployment/registering-your-dxp-server-with-lcs).

There are a few things to keep in mind when using environment tokens: 

-   Each environment can have only one token file. If you regenerate the token, 
    servers using the old file are disconnected from LCS and can't reconnect 
    until receiving the new file. If the server disconnects due to token 
    regeneration and is running version 4.0.2 or later of the LCS client app, 
    the server enters a 30-day grace period during which it functions normally. 
    This gives the administrator time to use the new token file to reconnect to 
    LCS. Servers running earlier versions of the LCS client app present users 
    with an error page until the administrator reconnects with the new token. 

-   Use caution when distributing the token file, as anyone can use it to 
    connect to your environment and consume an activation key in your 
    subscription. 

-   Minimal information (server name, location, etc...) is used to activate a 
    server with LCS. You can change this information from 
    [the server view in LCS](#using-the-server-view) 
    at any time. 

-   Environment tokens connect using OAuth. Using an environment token overrides 
    the OAuth authorization cycle. If LCS Administrators or Environment Managers 
    have never activated servers in LCS, the first time they do so an OAuth 
    authorization entry is created in LCS. If they've previously activated 
    servers in LCS, their existing credentials are used when they create a token 
    file. 

-   If the credentials of the LCS user who generated the token become invalid, 
    you must generate a new token and use it to reconnect to LCS. An LCS user's 
    credentials become invalid if the user leaves the LCS project or becomes an 
    LCS Environment Manager or LCS Environment Viewer in a different 
    environment. 

So why bother with environment tokens at all? Besides simplifying the LCS 
connection process, environment tokens are valuable in auto-scaling environments 
where algorithms create and destroy servers automatically. In this situation, 
having clients that activate and configure themselves is crucial.

**Note**: If your auto-scaling environment creates new server nodes from a 
server in a system image, that server can't require human interaction during 
setup. When creating such an image, you must change any portal property settings 
that prevent automatic setup. By default, @product@'s setup wizard requires 
human interaction. You must therefore set the `setup.wizard.enabled` property to 
`false` if you want your auto-scaling environment to create new nodes from the 
server.

As you've now seen, LCS is a powerful tool that helps you manage your @product@ 
servers. In addition to activating your servers, LCS lets you apply fix packs 
and monitor your servers' performance. If you have any problems with LCS, see
