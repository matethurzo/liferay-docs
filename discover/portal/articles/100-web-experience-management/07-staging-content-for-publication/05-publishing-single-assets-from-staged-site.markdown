# Publishing Single Assets From a Staged Site

The Staging framework offers an advanced publication process that gives you the
power to schedule your publication, edit and exclude modified pages/content,
etc. Sometimes though, stepping through the publication process is not necessary
and can be overkill. For example,

- What if you created a web content article and only want to publish it and
  nothing else?
- What if you want to publish a new folder of articles and their dependencies,
  but don't want to hassle with the publication process?
- What if you found a typo in a document and want to quickly fix it and push to
  the live site?

You're in luck! You can publish single assets from the staged site to the live
site without creating a staging publication process. You can publish the
following assets straight from their respective menus:

- Web Content
- Documents and Media

You'll step through an example to see how this is done.

1.  Make sure the Staging framework is
    [enabled](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/enabling-staging) and you're
    on the staged site.

2.  Create a web content article in the Product Menu's *Content* &rarr; *Web
    Content* menu.

3.  Once you've saved the new web content article, select its the *Actions*
    button (![Actions](../../../../images/icon-actions.png)) next to the article
    and select *Publish*.

4.  You're presented a Process Details page where you can view the progress of
    your single asset publication request.

There you have it! If you navigate to your live site's Web Content section, the
new web content article is available.

Similar to the regular staging publication process, your single asset
publications also include any associated dependencies. For example, if your web
content article contains an image, custom structure, and custom template, they
are all published together. The same concept applies for folders---if you
publish a folder containing several web content articles, all the articles and
their associated dependencies are published too.

Great! Now you know how to publish single assets.
